The "gifSearchApp" is an application that leverages the Giphy API to display gifs based on user-entered keywords in the search bar. Additionally, users have the option to modify the content rating through a dropdown menu located at the end of the search bar. A long press on any gif enables sharing functionality. The app provides two viewing formats for gifs: a grid view and a list view, which can be toggled using buttons located in the upper right corner.

Areas for Improvement:

  Unit tests were not implemented, which is a crucial aspect for ensuring app reliability and performance.
  
  There is uncertainty regarding the complete adherence to platform-specific guidelines, which is essential for consistent user experience across different devices.

Important Note:

For optimal performance and personalized experience, it is highly recommended to use your own API key, which can be conveniently generated on the Giphy Developer page.
